## Session #2 — 2026-04-24 (Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Code)

### What was done
1. Resolved git rebase merge conflict in `public/models.json` (caused by GitHub Actions auto-update during our work)
2. Re-ran `node scripts/patch-models.cjs` on merged data: 134/251 models patched
3. Successfully pushed all changes to GitHub (commit `1b89bd1`)
4. Created persistent context system:
   - `context/PROGRESS.md` — task progress tracker
   - `context/MEMORIES.md` — all memories and decisions
   - `context/SESSION_LOG.md` — this file
   - Updated `CLAUDE.md` with cross-session instructions
   - Created `scripts/save-context.sh` for one-click context save

### State at end of session
- All core fixes deployed and pushed
- Vercel should auto-deploy from `main`
- 251 models in models.json, 134 with META data
- 8 non-text models correctly classified (3 image, 5 tts)

### What to verify next
- Check https://www.myprompt.asia to confirm deployment
- `/api/models` should return 251+ models
- Non-text models should appear in target model selector

## Session #1 — 2026-04-23 (Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Code)

### What was done
1. **Model system overhaul**:
   - Expanded META from 8 to 55+ entries in `fetch-models.mjs`
   - Created `lookupMeta()` with prefix matching
   - Enhanced `classifyModel()` for image/video/tts/stt/embedding/ocr
   - Added category tabs to ModelSelector (target shows all types)
   - ModelPicker filters generator to `category === "text"` only

2. **Root cause fix for "auto-update has no effect"**:
   - Discovered `model-cache.ts` never read `public/models.json` without `MODELS_REGISTRY_URL`
   - Added local file reading as second tier fallback
   - This was THE fix — without it, 239 models were invisible

3. **Bug fixes**:
   - `fetchAnthropic` using `META[m.id]` instead of `lookupMeta(m.id)`
   - Missing `category` field in fetchGoogle/fetchOpenAI/fetchAnthropic
   - OpenAI KEEP regex missing `gpt-5` pattern
   - gpt-4o pricing wrong (5→2.5 input, 15→10 output)

4. **Post-processing**:
   - Created `scripts/patch-models.cjs` for one-time META application
   - Ran it: 115/239 → later 134/251 models patched

5. **Other improvements**:
   - `selectBestFromProbe` adapts scoring mode by target category
   - KeysSettings clears probe cache on save
   - GitHub Actions cron: 6 hours → 2 hours
   - Added `SYSTEM_STATE.json` generation in workflow
   - Bilingual error messages (中文/English)

### Git conflict resolution
- GitHub Actions committed auto-updates while we were working
- Rebase failed with conflict in `public/models.json`
- Resolved with `git pull --no-rebase -X ours` then re-patched

### Key commits
- `da7163e` feat: 全面改造模型系统
- `ef3810a` fix: 修复自动更新模型无效的根本原因
- `1b89bd1` chore: re-patch models.json after merge
